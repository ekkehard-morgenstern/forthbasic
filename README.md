# Forth BASIC
BASIC interpreter written in FORTH.

The main branch (master) is intended for usage with gFORTH, there might be other branches in the future.

The project is still in an early stage of development and at present contains just the screen editor that uses ANSI escape sequences for output to and input from text terminals.

To launch it, type 'gforth basic.fs' from the command line.
